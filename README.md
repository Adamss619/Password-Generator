# Password-Generator
Local Password Generator with encryption 

The first time the program is ran it will prompt you with an account name password and key. This information will be used as the
over all main account that controls access to all your passwords.
After the information is supplied a file will be generated with this information but encrypted. All passwords and account names generated in the program will be stored in their own file. 

**If the main password file is deleted the program will lose all access to previous accounts.**
